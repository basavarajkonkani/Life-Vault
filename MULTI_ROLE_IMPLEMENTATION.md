#### 👥 **User Roles & Permissions**

**🔵 Asset Owner**
- Register themselves with OTP + PIN
- Access Owner Dashboard with full asset management
- Add and manage nominees

- Full access to all their data

**🟢 Nominee**
- Auto-created by owners (no public registration)
- Login with OTP only (no PIN)

- Submit vault requests with death certificate upload
- View claim guides and status updates

**🟣 Admin**
